## Make a Read Me file

### Start with learning how to document progress using a [Read Me](https://www.makeareadme.com/) file and a [Mark Down](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#:~:text=To%20create%20a%20line%20break,spaces%2C%20and%20then%20type%20return.&text=This%20is%20the%20first%20line,this%20is%20the%20second%20line.) language.  
Using a Mark Down languages enables you to store your notes in GitHub so that you don't have to worry about which machine or app you were using -- or worse, paying for -- to keep notes.
