# QA Development

### Create your own documents in your Github Project

### Start with learning how to document progress using a [Read Me](https://www.makeareadme.com/) file and a [Mark Up](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24041/markdown-vs-markup-are-they-related) language  

Markup is a general term for content formatting - such as HTML - but [Mark Down](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#:~:text=To%20create%20a%20line%20break,spaces%2C%20and%20then%20type%20return.&text=This%20is%20the%20first%20line,this%20is%20the%20second%20line.) is a specific library that generates HTML markup.  
Using a Mark Down languages enables you to store your notes in GitHub so that you don't have to worry about which machine or app you were using -- or worse, paying for -- to keep notes.  

### Best Practices for Learning

Don't take in too much information with trying to apply knowledge by actually practicing code writing in a project. Like I am here, using a "mark up" language for this .md "read me" file in Github. 
What does it take to create a project?  
Do I need other people's permission or assistance to create, deploy, review a project?

### Define:  

Store, Method, Database, Mutation, Loop, Lambda, Broadcast, API, controllers, config, routes  

### Questions

Could this information be better orgainzed using an existing Wiki? What is a wiki? Should I make my own?
