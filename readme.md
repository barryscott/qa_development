# QA Development

### Create your own documents in your Github Project

### Start with learning how to document progress using a [Read Me](https://www.makeareadme.com/) file and a [Mark Up](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24041/markdown-vs-markup-are-they-related) language  

Markup is a general term for content formatting - such as HTML - but [Mark Down](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#:~:text=To%20create%20a%20line%20break,spaces%2C%20and%20then%20type%20return.&text=This%20is%20the%20first%20line,this%20is%20the%20second%20line.) is a specific library that generates HTML markup.  
Using a Mark Down languages enables you to store your notes in GitHub so that you don't have to worry about which machine or app you were using -- or worse, paying for -- to keep notes. 
A README should contain only the necessary information for developers to get started using and contributing to your project. Longer documentation is best suited for wikis.

### Best Practices for Learning

Don't take in too much information with trying to apply knowledge by actually practicing code writing in a project. Like I am here, using a "mark up" language for this .md "read me" file in Github. And as it turns out, [I should probably be using a Wiki](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32430473/what-are-the-main-functionality-differences-between-github-wiki-and-readme), but I had to make my Repository public and was not excited about that. It makes sense to be high level in the readme along with all the getting started information (i.e. local setup), and leave the long form information such as application features, design principles, etc. in the wiki.  
What does it take to create a project?  
Do I need other people's permission or assistance to create, deploy, review a project?

### Define:  

Store, Method, Database, Mutation, Loop, Lambda, Broadcast, API, controllers, config, routes  

### Questions

Could this information be better orgainzed using an existing Wiki? What is a wiki? Should I make my own?
